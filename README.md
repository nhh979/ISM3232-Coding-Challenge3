# Coding Challenge 3

This assignment helps us understand object-oriented programming in JavaScript by implementing a simple class structure with methods. We utilize the `constructor` method to create object instances of the class. We learn how to implement **class methods** to perform specific actions, such as `accelerate()` and `brake()` in this case. 

This assignment is located is the `cc_3.js` file.
